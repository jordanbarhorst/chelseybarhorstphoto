        <h2>Wedding FAQs</h2>
        <p>Thank you for considering me for your big day! Below you'll find some useful information about my wedding package. If you'd like to learn more or book me for your wedding, please <a href="mailto:chelseybarhorst@gmail.com">email me</a> or use the form below.</p>

        <h3>What Can We Expect From You As Our Photographer?</h3>
        <p>For starters, when you book with me, you actually get two photographers for your special day! My husband, Jordan, graduated with a degree in Visual Communications Technologies with a specialization in web, photo, and print. He is my second shooter for all weddings so none of your special moments are missed. We feel a huge responsibility when you choose us to capture the most important day of your life and we feel as though we are the safe-keepers of your most cherished memories.  We aim to provide anything you need from us on your wedding day and our main goal is that you feel relaxed and comfortable so you can enjoy your day completely. Jordan and I will help you be yourself and fun in front of the camera for portraits and group shots, but we are always mindful to keep our presence low-key for the intimate parts of the day. If you're interested, let's meet up for coffee and we can chat some more!</p>

        <h3>What should we wear to our engagement shoot?</h3>
        <p>Be yourselves and have fun with your outfit! Consider wearing complimenting outfits as opposed to "matching" outfits so you can work off of a color pallet while each getting to show off your individual style while still looking great together.</p>
