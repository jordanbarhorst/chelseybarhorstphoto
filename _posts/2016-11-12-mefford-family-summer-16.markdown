summary: Blooming sunflowers and warm sun filtering through the beginning-to-orange oak trees up above is how I got to spend this carefree fall Saturday! I got the impromptu chance to shoot a mini session of one of my good friend’s daughter and the beautiful light and company resulted in gorgeous photos. Jocelyn is mature and wise beyond her years and I was able to capture her beautiful spirit and personality with this fun shoot. Enjoy!
