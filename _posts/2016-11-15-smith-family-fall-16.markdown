summary: I’m so excited to share these photos with you! I met Lauren, Jason, and Austin at the Cincinnati Nature Center for an evening family session and we had the most perfect, soft, golden sunlight I’ve ever seen. Although the Nature Center was buzzing with kids playing all around and other photographers taking photos, we had so much fun staking out for the best spots and hunting down the best light that hit the water just right. This little family is so gorgeous and photogenic; they made my job too easy!
