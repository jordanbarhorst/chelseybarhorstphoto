summary: I had the pleasure this weekend of photographing a maternity shoot/pregnancy announcement for one of my best friends from college, Kelsie. All week Ohio had amazing weather in the 70's (secretly cringing because of global warming) however, Saturday we didn't get so lucky. I was in Columbus for an educational conference and it was the perfect time to get together with her and her husband, Dylan, to make some magic happen! Even though it was a cloudy and FREEZING afternoon, these two were gorgeous and their laughter brought the session to life. Their love for each other and their precious little one on the way is evident both in person and in these photos and I'm so blessed and excited to share these with you all. Enjoy!
