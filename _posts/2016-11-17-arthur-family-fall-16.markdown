summary: I’ve been so blessed as a photographer to shoot such great evening light and warm sunsets and this session was no exemption. This gorgeous family met me at Nesbit Park in Loveland,Ohio and we jumped in right away to catch that last bit of gorgeous warm light. The two little ones, Aleigh and Wesley were SO energetic and fun; I had a blast chasing after them and catching sweet giggles in between. They’re so sweet and there’s nothing I love more than capturing children in their element. Their mom and dad, Taylor and Adam, were so great to shoot as well- trusting me every step of the way. I love how the session turned out and I can’t wait to shoot them in the future. Enjoy!
