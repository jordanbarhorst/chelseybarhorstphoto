summary: This session is near and dear to my heart. My best friend, Caitlin, made the trek 3 hours south down 75 for me to do a family session with her fiance, Tyler, and his son, Xander. I’m so lucky to have gotten to know her little family over the past 3 years and it’s been amazing to see Xander grow into such a handsome young man. Although it was a chilly morning (read - FREEZING)they were absolute troopers and I was able to capture their hearts and love in these photos. Enjoy!
