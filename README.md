# Jordan Barhorst

Hey, I'm Jordan. I'm a Designer/Developer Hybrid/Unicorn from Cincinnati, Ohio. 

## Information about my blog

[My blog](http://www.jordanbarhorst.com) was built as an attempt to hammer down my "quickie" workflow. For projects that don't require databases, a ton of client side editing, or many dependencies, I totally plan on using this specific workflow. Working mostly in the smaller area around Cincinnati, this just so happens to be the majority of my clients.

The site was created utilizing the following frameworks/tools/thingamajigs:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
- [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/)
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
- [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
