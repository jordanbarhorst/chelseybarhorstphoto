My name is Jordan, and I like to design things. I make things for the web look really, really good, and work even better. I've also been known to dabble in photography, videography, and graphic design.

As a designer, I juggle many important details when I tackle each project. What does the client like? What does the client want? What does the client expect? What does the client need? These might seem like the same question, but anyone who's seen an episode of Mad Men (or anyone lucky enough to have worked in advertising) knows, these questions are very different, and each is very important. 

A good designer can take the answers to a couple of these questions and provide their client with something passable. A great designer goes further. A great designer gives the client not only what they like, want, expect and need, but also finds a way to go above and beyond to truly feel the same way about the finished product themselves. A great designer falls in love with each piece he or she creates. A great designer inspires others. I strive to be a great designer at the onset of each of my projects. 

When designing for the web, a lot of this has to take a back seat. In fact, one might argue that a great web designer goes unnoticed. In today's age, we expect things to "just work". We don't always notice great design on the web. What we do notice is bad design. Bad user interface. Bad user experience.

When a web designer can both inspire his peers and, at the same time, be completely anonymous to the end user, he is a great designer.

I am currently Web Specialist at [Vantiv](http://www.vantiv.com), one of the top payment processing companies in the world. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanbarhorst) to see what else I've done in my professional career, and check out [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/jordanbarhorst) to see some of my extracaricular design fun things. I also am constantly trying to be funny on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JordanBarhorst).

When I'm not designing things I'm hanging out with my fiancee, Chelsey, and cat, Kingsley. The three of us own a screenprinting company called [Blue Robin Boutique](https://www.etsy.com/shop/BlueRobinBoutique). I used to be a sports journalist, and still like to write about my Cincinnati Reds from time to time. Nowadays my writing mostly focuses on Web Design, and you can check that out over at my [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog/).

I'm always looking to meet and work with interesting people. If you have a project that you think I'd be good for, or if you just want to say hello, shoot me an email at [jordan.barhorst@gmail.com](mailto:jordan.barhorst@gmail.com). I can usually be bought for a couple glasses of Mad Tree or Rhinegeist beer, a breakfast buffet, or Reds tickets.
