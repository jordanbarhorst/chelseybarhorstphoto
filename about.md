My name is Jordan, and I like to design things. I make things for the web look really, really good, and work even better. I've also been known to dabble in photography, videography, and graphic design. 

I am currently Web Specialist at [Vantiv](http://www.vantiv.com), one of the top payment processing companies in the world. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanbarhorst) to see what else I've done in my professional career, and check out [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com/jordanbarhorst) to see some of my extracaricular design fun things. I also am constantly trying to be funny on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/JordanBarhorst).

When I'm not designing things I'm hanging out with my fiancee, Chelsey, and cat, Kingsley. The three of us own a screenprinting company called [Blue Robin Boutique](https://www.etsy.com/shop/BlueRobinBoutique). I used to be a sports journalist, and still like to write about my Cincinnati Reds from time to time. Nowadays my writing mostly focuses on Web Design, and will eventually be housed right here at my blog, when I've got it up and running.

I'm always looking to meet and work with interesting people. If you have a project that you think I'd be good for, or if you just want to say hello, shoot me an email at [jordan.barhorst@gmail.com](mailto:jordan.barhorst@gmail.com). I can usually be bought for a couple glasses of Mad Tree or Rhinegeist beer, a breakfast buffet, or Reds tickets.
