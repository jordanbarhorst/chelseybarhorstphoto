    <p>Growing up, I thought my unique perspective on life and ability to connect with anyone I encounter was pretty much only useful to maybe make a few friends or snag a job but it turned out to be so much more. These talents have allowed me to grow and develop my life’s passions through my relationships, career as an educator, and lifelong passion of photography.</p>
    <p>As a lifestyle and portrait photographer, I absolutely love the raw reality of different sessions and individuals I encounter as well as the beauty in those fleeting moments in between the clicks of my camera. The magic that happens when I’m capturing the personality and heart of my subject is what got me started on this journey in the first place and the thing that keeps me going.
    <p>I am an artist who photographs people using my innate ability to capture any soul. I would love to have the opportunity to shoot your family or event, and help capture a moment forever.</p>
